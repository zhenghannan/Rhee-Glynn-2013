# Rhee-Glynn-2013-
An unbiased Monte-Carlo estimator for two dimensional jump-diffusion process (with stochastic volatility).

# GlynnRheeLF.cpp & DeltaRcpp.R
These are the codes that construct the unbiased estimator introduced by Rhee & Glynn (2013).

# X_generation.R
This code generate the stock price process using known parameters and Heston model.

# Main.R
This code applies maximum-likelihood to calibrate the parameters with generated stock prices.
